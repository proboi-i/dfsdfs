== History ==
The former national carrier, Air Burundi was established in 1971, began operations in 1975 and ceased operations in 2009. As part of previous attempts at revival of Air Burundi, the matter came up for discussion during a Cabinet of Burundi meeting on 26 May 2020.When the matter came up again in a cabinet meeting on 28 December 2020, a decision was made to merge Air Burundi assets, with those of SOBUGEA to constitute the government's 92 percent contribution to the new Burundi Airlines. Other shareholders include the state-owned insurer, Société d’Assurances du Burundi (SOCABU) and the estate of the defunct Belgian airline, SABENA.


== Fleet ==
In 2012 the defunct Air Burundi took delivery of a Xian MA60, 52-seater, two-engine turboprop aircraft. Under arrangement with the manufacturers, another similar aircraft was due to be delivered later. The new Burundi Airlines is expected to begin service with those two airplanes. More aircraft will be acquired as need arises, going forward.
