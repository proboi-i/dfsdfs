=== Safety ===
St. Lucia, like many other Caribbean countries, has been experiencing an increase in serious crime over the past few years. There has been an increase in robberies, burglaries, harassment, and even incidents of violent crime against tourists. Some of these cases have been reported in the international media and as such, St. Lucia's destination image is at risk. In an attempt to control the crime problem, the government has implemented a number of measures, which includes tougher penalties for some crime. However, these measures have not had a great effect on the crime rate. This has caused a noticeable decline in the tourist industry on the island.In an attempt to combat crime against tourists, the Minister of Tourism has adopted a number of measures. In collaboration with the Royal St. Lucia Police Force, they have commissioned a team of Special Constables, who have powers of arrest. These Constables were placed into two groups: the Rapid Response Team and the Rangers. The Rapid Response Team performs both foot and mobile patrol in the tourist and hotel areas both in the north and south of the island. The Rangers also referred to as Beach Rangers, are responsible for patrolling the beaches near the hotels all over the island. By doing so the hope is to assure safety to the visitors on the islands. They also assist the hotel security by patrolling the hotel area.Additionally, the prominent tourist sites located in Soufriere, such as the Drive-in Volcano, The Rain Forest, The Diamond Falls, and The Piton Heritage Site have private security officers, who have been hired by the Ministry of Tourism. The Port police also provide security to the tourists from the time they leave the cruise vessel until they return to the port area. They also ensure that the tourist boats are secure while in the port. This is done in collaboration with the Marine Police who constantly patrol the seaport area while the tourist boats are in the harbor. Whenever tourist boats come to the island, police patrols are normally increased in the area in order to ensure that the tourists are secure while on the island.The Ministry of Tourism, in collaboration with the Royal St. Lucia Police, has also created a system of police audit checks on hotels. This system allows the police to carry out regular checks on security at the hotels around the island. They also advise the hotels on what security changes should be made in order to safeguard tourists. Tourists are still advised to be aware of any suspicious behavior and report anything immediately.
