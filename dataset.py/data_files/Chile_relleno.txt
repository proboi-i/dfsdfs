The chile relleno (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtʃile reˈʝeno], literally "stuffed chile") is a dish in Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. In 1858, it was described as a "green chile pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated with eggs".The most common pepper used is Puebla's poblano pepper, though New Mexico chile, pasilla, or even jalapeño peppers are popular as well. It is typically stuffed with melted cheese, such as queso Chihuahua or queso Oaxaca or with picadillo meat made of diced pork, raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered in an egg white batter, simply corn masa flour and fried, or without any batter at all. Although it is often served in a tomato sauce, the sauces can vary.


== Regional variation ==


=== Mexico ===
Some regional versions in Mexico use rehydrated dry chiles such as anchos or pasillas.


=== United States ===
In the United States, chiles rellenos are usually filled with asadero or Monterey Jack cheese, but can also be found with cheddar or other cheeses, as well as ground or minced meat. Typically the chile is then dipped in an egg white batter and either pan-fried or deep-fried. Chiles rellenos are a popular cuisine in the U.S. state of New Mexico, where the Hatch chile is revered for its slender (rather than round) shape and medium-to-hot flavor. In the contiguous U.S., rellenos are typically served with red or green chile sauce or mole.Variations, which can be seen based on regional tastes or experimentation, include:

Chiles en nogada
Pecan-encrusted
Crab-filled
Inside of a "chile relleno burrito"
In a casserole form (which can be more practical for serving groups of people)
Tuna filled
Squash blossom stuffed
Mushroom stuffed
Shrimp stuffedA recipe from 1914 (as "chili reinas") is published in a period guidebook to San Francisco restaurants.


=== Guatemala ===
In Guatemala, the pimiento pepper is stuffed with shredded pork and vegetables. Like the Mexican version, it is covered with egg batter and fried. It is served with tomato sauce or inside a bread bun.
