= Hondurans = 
Hondurans (Spanish: Hondureñas or Hondureños) are the citizens of Honduras. Most Hondurans live in Honduras, although there is also a significant Honduran diaspora, particularly in the United States, Spain, and many smaller communities in other countries around the world.


== Catracha or Catracho ==
Latin Americans refer to a person from Honduras as a Catracho or Catracha. The term was coined by Nicaraguans in the mid-19th century when Honduran General Florencio Xatruch returned from battle with his Honduran and Salvadoran soldiers after defeating American freebooters commanded by William Walker, whose purpose was to re-establish slavery and take over all of Central America. As the general and his soldiers returned, some Nicaraguans yelled out ¡Aquí vienen los xatruches!, meaning "Here come Xatruch's boys!" However, Nicaraguans had so much trouble pronouncing the general's Catalan last name that they altered the phrase to  los catruches and ultimately settled on las catrachas or los catrachos.


== History ==

Before the conquest, "Honduras was inhabited by an aboriginal population descended from different ethnic groups." 1 Among these are: Los Lencas, Payas, Chorotegas, Xicaques, Chortis, just to mention a few. All of these groups lacked "cultural unity," and "probably had a Mesoamerican and South American cultural origin. "According to some historians: «These cultures achieved great progress in the various fields of human knowledge, driven by the development of a varied agriculture ... In this way they guaranteed adequate food for their large population. They also applied techniques of great perfection in fabrics and ceramics. They developed an intense and varied trade. »
In the north-western section of Honduras predominated the peoples of the Chortís, a Mayan group located in Copán and Ocotepeque, and the Lencas that extended through the departments of Santa Bárbara, Lempira, Intibucá, La Paz, Comayagua, Francisco Morazán and Valle. And part of what today comprises the territory of El Salvador.The rest of the Honduran territory was inhabited by peoples from the south of the continent, with a nomadic and semi-nomadic culture, governed by primitive communal production relations. Among these peoples were Tolupanes (also known as "xicaques"), Pechs (also known as "payas"), Tawahkas and Misquitos who, as a whole, made up the majority of the country's population.
According to the Honduran sociologist Guillermo Molina Chocano, the first counts of the Honduran population are the product of estimates made by "historians, chroniclers, and travelers." Most of these coincide that upon the arrival of the Spanish, the aboriginal population both in Honduras and the rest of America was very numerous. For example, the Milanese traveler, Girolaneo Benzoni (Historia del Nuevo Mundo, 1572) assures that:
"When the Spanish went to conquer the region of Honduras ... they encountered more than four hundred thousand Indians ..."Others (El Costo de la Conquista, 1992) claim that "the aboriginal population of Honduras was approximately 800,000 indigenous people.
For some historians "The starting point to study the population is the general census for the province of Honduras prepared by the mayor Don Ramón de Anguiano." "9 10 which" gave in 1801 a population of 130,000 in 249 inhabited centers." "If the evolution of the Honduran population is compared, since the end of the 16th century, "with the figures of 1778, 1791 and In 1801, no substantial modifications are observed in the behavior of the population ... "In such a way" says Molina Chocano, "that it is not possible to specify the evolution of the population in the Colonial period as a whole." However, they can detect some phenomena in the years of transition towards the republican stage and throughout the 19th century.
In 1816, five years before independence, "the Mayor Don Juan Antonio Tomos issued a report of his visit in 1815, in which he indicated 100,000 inhabitants in 39 curatos and 8 villages of Caribbean blacks near Trujillo (estimated at about 10,000 ) for a total of 110,000 inhabitants. After independence" the population of 1826 (200,000 people) is based on the calculation made by Mr. Dionisio de Herrera, former head of the state of Honduras; the same as the of 1850 (350,000 people) that rests on the calculation made by Mr. E. G. Squier "13 If the census of 182614 is taken into account and compared" with the calculation of the Archbishop of Guatemala, Don Francisco de Paula García Peláez, in 1838, (173,365 inhabitants (21,165 Spaniards, 106,668 Ladinos and 45,532 Indians), 15 a clear decrease in the rate of population growth can be observed in the years "after independence and" during the existence of the Central American Federation. "
