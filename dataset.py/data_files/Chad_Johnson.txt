Chad Ochocinco Johnson (born Chad Javon Johnson; January 9, 1978), known from 2008 to 2012 as Chad Ochocinco, is a former  American football wide receiver. He played college football for Santa Monica College and Oregon State University, and played 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cincinnati Bengals, New England Patriots, and the Miami Dolphins. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL) in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, and played for the Bengals for 10 seasons. In 2011, Johnson was traded to the New England Patriots, for whom he played in Super Bowl XLVI. In 2012, Johnson played for the Miami Dolphins during preseason but was released following his arrest for domestic violence. He played for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 2014 to 2015, and played one game in 2017 for Mexican team Monterrey Fundidores of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional. Johnson emerged as one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers of the 2000s and owns nearly every Bengals receiving record.
In April 2011, CNBC listed Johnson as number 1 on its list of "Most Influential Athletes In Social Media." Johnson was a six-time NFL Pro Bowler, was named to four All-Pro teams and was voted as the number one wide receiver on the Bengals 40th Anniversary team.


== Early life and college career ==
Johnson was born in Miami, Florida. After graduating from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1997, Johnson attended Langston University but did not play football. In 1997, he transferred to Santa Monica College, a community college in Santa Monica, California. While at Santa Monica College, he played with future NFL wide receiver Steve Smith. In 2000, Johnson transferred to Oregon State University, after being aggressively recruited by coach Dennis Erickson to play for the OSU team. Alongside future Bengals teammate T. J. Houshmandzadeh, he led his team to an 11–1 season and a victory over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl that year. Johnson also broke a school record for the longest touchdown reception with a 97-yard reception in a game against Stanford.

== Professional career ==


=== Cincinnati Bengals ===
The Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League chose Johnson in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft with the 36th overall pick.
In Johnson's rookie year, he saw moderate playing time, catching 28 passes for 329 yards and one touchdown. In 2003, he set a Bengals franchise record by recording 1,355 receiving yards. In 2004, he caught 95 passes for 9 touchdowns and 1,274 yards, including 117 receiving yards in a 58-48 win against the Cleveland Browns.


==== 2005 season ====
Johnson surpassed his franchise record in 2005, recording 1,432 yards. He led the AFC in receiving yards for four consecutive seasons, and he made the Pro Bowl five straight times from 2003 to 2007.


===== "The List" =====
During the 2005 NFL season, Johnson announced that he would keep a checklist, titled who Covered 85 in '05, that would evaluate the defensive backs who successfully managed to cover him. On November 2, 2005, Marvin Lewis, the Bengals' head coach, replaced Johnson's list with another one titled, Did 85 do everything he could to lead his team to victory 11-6-05. The list, an obvious parody of the original, asked several questions regarding Johnson's performance both on and off the field. According to the Bengals' official website, the list was aimed to antagonize their divisional rival, the Baltimore Ravens, whom the Bengals would play in four days. Johnson was not pleased with the new list, as he had developed a superstitious faith in the older list. He had a stellar performance during the game, prompting the return of the original list.In 2007, Degree and Yahoo! created an online version of his checklist. The checklist allowed fans to vote for which NFL quarterback Johnson would like to play catch with the most. Every vote helped him raise money for his charity project, "Feed the Children".


==== 2006 season ====
On April 20, 2006, Johnson signed an extension to his contract through 2011.During the first half of the 2006 season, Johnson saw little activity. After being bogged down by an early injury, his productivity endured a sharp decline. During the first eight weeks of the 2006 season, Johnson only caught two touchdown passes, while only amassing 483 yards. However, after shaving his Mohawk and changing his mentality, he had a breakout game in a losing effort against the San Diego Chargers. Johnson accumulated 260 receiving yards and scored two touchdowns, which broke the previous Bengals record for most receiving yards in a game. He went on to amass 190 receiving yards and three touchdowns in a 31-16 win over the New Orleans Saints in the following week. This gave Johnson a then NFL record of 450 receiving yards in back-to-back games (to be surpassed by Josh Gordon of the Cleveland Browns, who amassed 498 yards in consecutive games in 2013), breaking the previous record of 448 set by San Francisco 49ers receiver John Taylor in 1989. In the following week, he gained 123 yards receiving, breaking the three-game receiving record since the NFL–AFL merger in 1970 and coming within 40 yards of the all-time record.
Johnson finished the 2006 season with 87 receptions for a league leading 1,369 yards and seven touchdowns. He was the first Bengal ever to lead the NFL in receiving yards. Johnson and Houshmandzadeh also became the first Bengals teammates to each amass over 1,000 receiving yards in the same season.
In addition to being one of the most productive receivers in the NFL, Johnson was also one of the most popular in balloting for the Pro Bowl. In the fan voting for the 2006 game, he finished first in votes for wide receivers, and fourth overall with 987,650 total votes. Johnson earned nationwide attention for his flamboyant attitude, which was often seen during his infamous end zone celebrations after catching touchdown passes. In a list released in August 2006 by Fox Sports listing the top 10 showboats in professional sports, Johnson topped the list.


==== 2007 season ====
In the first game of the season, on Monday Night Football against the Baltimore Ravens, Johnson scored the game's first touchdown on a 39-yard pass from Carson Palmer. Following the touchdown, he grabbed a jacket that resembles the Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees' jacket that said, "Future H.O.F. 20??" Johnson finished the game with five receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown. In the next game, against the Cleveland Browns, he racked up 209 yards on 11 catches for two touchdowns in the 51-45 loss. This gave Johnson a career total of 7,229 receiving yards, breaking the Bengals' franchise record previously held by Isaac Curtis. The very next game, against the Seattle Seahawks, he totaled nine receptions for 138 yards as the Bengals lost again. Against the New York Jets, in which the Bengals won 38-31, Johnson had three receptions for 102 yards and a rush for 15 yards.
In the fourth quarter of the Bengals' week-nine loss to the Buffalo Bills, Johnson was rolled off the field on a stretcher, with a reported head injury. He dove out for a pass, with under a minute left in the 33-21 loss, and then was sandwiched by Donte Whitner and Coy Wire. Johnson was reported to be mobile at the hospital. He finished the game with three catches for 48 yards. A CT scan performed to detect brain injury was negative, and Johnson did not miss any games from the injury.
Over his next two games, Johnson did not score any touchdowns or gain more than 86 yards, but he had a breakout performance in a November 25 win over the Tennessee Titans, catching a career-high 12 passes for 103 yards and three touchdowns. This gave Johnson over 1,000 receiving yards for the sixth consecutive season, and moved him past Carl Pickens as the Bengals all-time leader in receptions.
By week 15, Johnson and Houshmandzadeh both gained over 1,000 receiving yards for the second year in a row. However, a loss to the San Francisco 49ers that week ensured the team would finish the year with their first losing season since 2002. In the Bengals' season finale, Johnson had four catches for 131 yards and two touchdowns in a win over the Miami Dolphins, giving him 93 receptions for 1,440 yards and 8 touchdowns on the season.
Johnson's 1,440 yards set a new Bengals' franchise record, breaking his own record of 1,432 in 2005. It was the third time that Johnson finished a season with a new Bengals record for receiving yards. His yardage was third most in the NFL, his receptions were 12th most, and his touchdowns were tied for 15th most in the league.
Johnson was passed up for the 2008 Pro Bowl team, which instead selected his teammate T. J. Houshmandzadeh. Due to injury, however, Patriots' receiver Randy Moss was forced to withdraw from the Pro Bowl, and Johnson was selected as his replacement. The selection marked his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl selection. Johnson and Houshmandzadeh became the first pair of Bengals receivers to make the Pro Bowl in the same year.


==== 2008 season ====

On January 13, 2008, Johnson was a guest on ESPN's Mike & Mike radio show. During the interview, he addressed how the media and team treated him during the 2007 season, saying, "I was labeled selfish and a cancer, and it hurt...Fingers were pointed at me this year. If the team and the organization wants to further itself (make the playoffs), I think you need to get rid of the problem...It hurt me. To do me that way and not to have my back. Things were said, and nobody came to my defense." However, head coach Marvin Lewis commented on the issue by saying that the Bengals would not be trading Johnson. "He is a Cincinnati Bengal for quite a while," Lewis said.On February 4, ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported that Johnson felt betrayed by Lewis and was privately threatening to sit out the 2008 season, though his agent Drew Rosenhaus denied it. When asked about trade rumors, Johnson said "Call me, Dan," referring to Redskins' owner Daniel Snyder, On April 22, the Cincinnati Bengals' declined a Washington Redskins' trade for Johnson involving a first round 2008 selection and a 2009 selection. and on NFL Network's NFL Total Access, Johnson said he did not want a pay raise from the Bengals, but desired a "change of scenery". Lewis stated he had not spoken to Johnson since the last regular season game, and reiterated his lack of interest in a trade. After several weeks of silence, in April, Johnson again announced he wanted to be traded, and caused a rift with teammates by refusing to attend off-season workout programs and practices. Nine days before the opening of the Bengals' mandatory minicamp on June 12, Johnson told ESPN The Magazine that "of course I (will be)" attending, confirmed by his agent. After ankle surgery on June 18, Johnson returned to full practice in August. He suffered a partially torn labrum in the first preseason game on August 17, but decided to play the entire season with the injury.On August 29, Johnson legally changed his last name to Ochocinco.
The Bengals began the season 0-8, with Carson Palmer forced out for the season with an injury incurred early in the campaign and Johnson experiencing his worst statistical season of his career to date. Johnson totaled 11 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown in the first four games of the season, unable to gain more than 37 yards' receiving in any of the contests. Following a dismal performance (three receptions for 43 yards) against the Dallas Cowboys in a loss, Johnson had consecutive games with 50-yard receiving totals (57 against the New York Giants & 52 against the Pittsburgh Steelers). Johnson then had 44 yards on five receptions in a loss to the Houston Texans.
However, the Bengals won their first game of the season, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, in week 9 by a score of 21-19. In that game, Johnson had five receptions for 37 yards and two touchdowns. The two scores marked the first multi-touchdown game of the season for Johnson.
Johnson finished the season with 53 catches for 540 yards and four touchdowns — his worst statistical season since his rookie campaign.


==== 2009 season ====
Before the start of the 2009 season, the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants expressed interest in Johnson if he were to be placed on the market after he missed voluntary team offseason workouts. In July 2009, Johnson said that he would use Twitter during games, but the NFL banned it. In the August 20 preseason game against the New England Patriots, Johnson took over placekicking duties for the injured Shayne Graham. He kicked off and made an extra point in the game, which ended up deciding the Bengals' 7-6 win.
During the season, Johnson expressed remorse for the developments in the 2008 season and attempted to make it up to the fans in Cincinnati through numerous actions. Many of those involved public appearances (usually involving the publication of his autobiography) and also by inviting Bengals fans to dinner and movie showings through his Twitter account, gatherings for which he picked up the tab. Many of the events were featured on the Bengals' official website.

Johnson went on to record his seventh career 1,000 yard season, catching 72 passes for 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns. He finished the season just 48 yards short of the 10,000 career receiving yards milestone and with 62 career touchdown catches, just one short of the franchise record held by Carl Pickens.
On January 15, Johnson was announced as a Pro Bowl selection to replace Patriots receiver Wes Welker, who was injured in the final week of the regular season. It was Johnson's sixth Pro Bowl selection, tying Lemar Parrish for the second highest total in franchise history.


==== 2010 season ====
Johnson opened up the 2010 season with 12 receptions for 159 yards and a touchdown in the Bengals' opening day loss to the Patriots. In doing so, he tied the franchise record for touchdown catches (which he later surpassed) and became the sixth player in NFL history to amass 10,000 receiving yards with one team. The following week, Johnson became the 30th player in NFL history to surpass 700 career receptions, catching four passes for 44 yards in a 15-10 win.


=== New England Patriots ===

On July 28, 2011, the New England Patriots acquired Johnson in a trade with Cincinnati after he restructured a three-year contract for $6.35 million. The Patriots traded two draft picks, a fifth round pick in 2012 and a sixth round pick in 2013.Johnson had statistically the least productive season of his career, catching 15 passes for 276 yards and one touchdown, all career lows.

Quarterback Carson Palmer ripped the label off the jersey to reveal the usual "C. Johnson".  According to ESPN, Johnson was fined $5,000 for the stunt despite the fact that he did not wear the "Ocho Cinco" name tag during the game.Johnson legally changed his name to Chad Javon Ochocinco on August 29, 2008. The Cincinnati Bengals decided to allow him to have it on the back of his jersey, though Ochocinco continued to wear his old "C. Johnson" jersey during the 2008 football season, because of contractual obligations with Reebok. He played with "OCHOCINCO" on the back of his jersey from the 2009 season to the 2011 season.

On January 25, 2011, Ochocinco told an ESPN reporter that he would be changing his last name back to Johnson. However, on June 30, 2011, Ochocinco told an ESPN reporter that because of financial issues, he would keep his name as Chad Ochocinco and not go back to Johnson.On July 23, 2012, after Ochocinco's move to the Miami Dolphins, he legally changed his name back to Chad Johnson at a Broward County courthouse because he "wanted to reconnect with his former self".
