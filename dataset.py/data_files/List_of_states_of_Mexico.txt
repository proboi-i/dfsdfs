The states of Mexico are first-level administrative territorial entities of the country of Mexico, which is officially named United Mexican States. There are 32 federal entities in Mexico (31 states and the capital, Mexico City, as a separate entity that is not formally a state).States are further divided into municipalities. Mexico City is divided in boroughs, officially designated as demarcaciones territoriales or alcaldías, similar to other state's municipalities but with different administrative powers.

Mexico's post agency, Correos de México, does not offer an official list of state name abbreviations, and as such, they are not included below.  A list of Mexican states and several versions of their abbreviations can be found here.
