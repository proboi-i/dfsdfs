Administratively, Tajikistan is divided into:

one autonomous region (Russian: автономная область; Tajik: вилояти мухтор, viloyati mukhtor)
two regions (Tajik: вилоятҳо, viloyatho Persian: ولایتها), sing. Tajik: вилоят, viloyatو Persian: ولایت, Russian: область/вилоят )
the Districts of Republican Subordination
the capital city, Dushanbe.
1 The direct translation from Tajik is Kuhistoni Badakhshon Autonoumous Region, but the name translated from Russian is more commonly used in English.
Each region is divided into districts (nohiya or rayon), which are further subdivided into jamoats (full name jamoati dehot), and then villages/settlements (deha). Tajikistan has a total of 58 (not including 4 districts of the capital city Dushanbe) districts.
