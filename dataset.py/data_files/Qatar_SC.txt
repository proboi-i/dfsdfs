== History ==


=== Formation (1972) ===
In 1972, Al-Oruba merged with Al-Nasour to forma new football club named Al-Esteqlal. Former player Saad Mohammed Saleh was selected as the first coach. Al Esteqlal was one of the strongest clubs since its establishment, winning its first official Q-League season in 1972–73. The next year, in 1974, Al Sadd hired head coach Hassan Othman from the club in addition to 14 of its players, including Hassan Mattar and Mubarak Anber, much to the dismay of club president Hamad bin Suhaim. During this period, transfers could be made unconditionally in Qatari football. Despite the resounding difficulties arising from the transfer fiasco, it continued with its success, winning the 1976–77 season and supplying the national team with some of its most prominent players.


=== 1981–present: Qatar SC ===
Al Esteqlal was renamed Qatar SC in 1981. However, it gradually faded into obscurity for the next 2 decades, with the league being dominated by Al Arabi, Al Sadd, and Al Rayyan. The club won the Qatar Crown Prince Cup in 2002 and also won the 2002–03 league season by three points. They won the Crown Prince Cup the same year, and again in 2009. The club was relegated to Qatari Second Division after the 2015-16 season, but were promoted back to the top division the next season.
