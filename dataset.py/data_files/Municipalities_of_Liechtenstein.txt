The principality of Liechtenstein is divided into eleven municipalities (German: Gemeinden, singular Gemeinde), most consisting of only a single town. Five of the Gemeinden fall within the electoral district of Unterland (lower country), while the other six are within the Oberland (upper country).

== Exclaves and enclaves ==
The municipalities of Liechtenstein, the Gemeinden, exhibit complex shapes, despite their small size.
Seven of the Gemeinden have one or more exclaves, in addition to the main territory:

Gamprin: 1 exclave
Eschen: 1 exclave
Planken: 4 exclaves, of which 1 is a true enclave
Schaan: 4 exclaves, of which 1 is a true enclave
Vaduz: 6 exclaves, of which 2 are true enclaves
Triesenberg: 1 exclave
Balzers: 2 exclaves


== Data codes ==
In ISO 3166-2, the codes of the municipalities start with LI-, followed by two digits (01â€“11, assigned in alphabetical order).
In FIPS 10-4 (standard withdrawn in 2008), the codes of the municipalities started with LS-, followed by the same two digits as the ISO codes.
As a member of the EFTA, Liechtenstein is included in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). The three NUTS levels all correspond to the country itself (NUTS-1: LI0; NUTS-2: LI00; NUTS-3: LI000). Below the NUTS levels, there are two LAU levels (LAU-1: electoral districts; LAU-2: municipalities).
