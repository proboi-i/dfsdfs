== History ==
The Belize District was the area first settled by Europeans. They developed estates along the rivers and creeks; because these waterways were their transportation highways. Many of the estates were referred to as the owner's 'bank'(as in the banks of a river). Therefore, Mr. Lord's estate on the bank of the Belize River became Lord's Bank and Mr. Flowers' home place on this same river became Flowers Bank. Many of these old estates have grown into villages; while other places on our map such as Baker, Bob Eiley, Bocotora, Butcher Burns, Lime Walk, More Force, Nago Bank, Washing Tree, Cedar Bank, Churchyard, Egypt, Watters Bank, and White Hill are old estates which did not become villages. Some places like Davis Bank and Tropical Park have now become parts of larger communities.
