== History ==
Peru has competed in the Miss Universe pageant since 1952 and in the Miss World pageant since 1959. In the Miss Universe pageant, their first representative was Ada Gabriela Bueno, who was crowned as the first Miss Peru in a ceremony at the Lawn Tennis Club of Lima and competed in Miss Universe 1952. Bueno traveled to Long Beach, California to represent her country, but failed to enter the group of semifinalists.
The runner-ups and finalists of the annual Miss Peru and Miss World Peru pageants are sent to compete in other events, such as Miss Supranational, Miss Grand International, Miss Eco International, Reina Hispanoamericana, Miss United Continents, Miss Top Model of the World, Miss Supertalent, Reinado Internacional del Cafe, Reinado Mundial del Banano, Reinado Mundial de la Ganadería, Miss Intercontinental, Miss Globe, Miss Landscapes International, Miss America Latina, Miss Asia Pacific, Miss Tourism Queen International, Miss Bikini International, and Miss Atlantico Internacional, among others.
In the 1950s, Peru was one of the few South American countries that competed in major international competitions such as the Miss Universe and Miss World pageants. The country became consistent joining the group of semifinals five times in the 1950s and four times during the 1960s. Peru is known for having the first Spanish-speaking Miss Universe in 1957, Gladys Zender.
Peru participated in the Miss World pageant for the first time in 1959, represented by María Elena Rossel Zapata, who was ranked as the 1st runner-up. This was the first time that a Latin American country won 2nd place in the Miss World pageant.
In 1967, Peru won the Miss World crown for the first time with Madeline Hartog-Bel, exactly ten years after Gladys Zender won the Miss Universe pageant in 1957, Hartog-Bel had previously participated in Miss Universe 1966, where she placed among the 15 semifinalists.
In 1973, Peru did not send its representative, Mary Núñez Bartra, to the Miss Universe Pageant, because she was prevented from participating by the president of the republic, Juan Velasco Alvarado. He considered the contest was the product of American capitalism, and a country with which he did not have good relations. This was the only occasion in which a Miss Peru did not participate in the Miss Universe except for in 1955 and 1974, when no contest was held. Given the refusal of Alvarado, Bartra was sent to Miss World 1973 in London, England.In 1982, Peru became the first South American country to host the Miss Universe pageant. Miss Universe 1982 was held in the Coliseo Amauta in Lima on July 26, 1982. The winner was the 18 year old Karen Baldwin from Canada, who became the first representative of her country to win the Miss Universe title. A group of twelve semifinalists were chosen from a total of 77 candidates, representatives from the many countries and territories that competed in this version of the contest. This was the sixteenth consecutive spirited contest for the American television presenter Bob Barker. The show was broadcast via satellite by the U.S. network CBS in collaboration with Panamericana Televisión. In this edition, Peru was represented by Francesca Zaza, who was among the 12 semifinalists and won the prize for Best National Costume.
In 1987, Jessica Newton was chosen to represent the country in Miss Universe 1987 in Singapore. The winner of this edition was the Chilean Cecilia Bolocco. Newton was among the 10 semifinalists. Years later Newton took the franchise of the Miss Peru pageant and was responsible for organizing the event and preparing Peruvian queens for the Miss Universe and Miss World for 12 years.
After many years in 1996, Peru reappeared in the contest with Natali Sacco, who entered in the top 10 in Miss Universe 1996, and in 1998, Mariana Larrabure also entered the top 10 in Miss World 1998. Four years later, in 2002, Marina Mora joined the Top 5, winning third place in the Miss World 2002 pageant. The following year Claudia Ortiz de Zevallos placed in the Top 15 in Miss Universe 2003 and took the second place prize for Best National Costume, and Claudia Hernández placed in the top 20 in Miss World 2003 and won the award for Best Evening Gown. This was so far the only time that Peru had classified the same year in the Miss Universe and Miss World.
In terms of Miss Universe, since the new millennium, Peru came back to the final round of the competition when Claudia Ortiz de Zevallos was a semifinalist in the Miss Universe 2003 pageant held in Panama, then also joined the group of semifinalists in the Miss Earth 2003 pageant. Liesel Holler failed to reach the semifinals in 2004, but like her predecessor also joined the group of semifinalists in the Miss Earth 2004 pageant. Débora Sulca made Peru's comeback in the contest in 2005, placing in the Top 10 and finishing 6th overall (Peru's highest placement to date since winning the crown in 1957).
At Miss World, Peru featured a successful streak of three placements that ended with its second title. Marina Mora finished as 2nd runner-up in the 2002 edition and her successor Claudia Hernandez placed in the Top 20 in 2003. In 2004, Peru returned to international glory in the field of beauty pageants in December 2004, when María Julia Mantilla won the Miss World title thanks to a worldwide vote through text messages and phone calls, which occurred for the first time in the history of the event. She won the crown of Miss World 2004. The first runner-up was Claudia Cruz, from the Dominican Republic, and the second runner-up was Nancy Randall, from the United States.
In 2012, Nicole Faverón made Peru's return to the Miss Universe pageant after seven years of absence by placing at Miss Universe 2012.
Valeria Piazza became the 18th Peruvian to place in Miss Universe history, by making the Top 13 at Miss Universe 2016.
Peru gained its fourth international crown with the title of Miss Grand International 2017, won by Maria Jose Lora. The country returned to the placement circle of Miss World after a 13-year drought when Pamela Sanchez made the Top 40 on the final night.
