The Republic of Ireland had a population of 5,123,536 at the 2022 census.


== Demographic history ==

The island of Ireland's population has fluctuated over history. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Ireland experienced a major population boom as a result of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. In the 50-year period 1790–1840, the population of the island doubled from 4 million to 8 million. At its peak, Ireland's population density was similar to that of England and continental Europe.
This changed dramatically with the Great Famine of the mid-19th century, which led to mass starvation and consequent mass emigration. In the area covering the present day Republic of Ireland, the population reached about 6.5 million in the mid-1840s. Ten years later it was down to 5 million. The population continued a slow decline well into the 20th century, with the Republic recording a low of 2.8 million in the 1961 census.During the 1960s, the population started to grow once more, although slowly as emigration was still common. In the 1990s the country entered a period of rapid economic growth as a result of the Celtic Tiger Irish economic boom, and the Republic started to receive immigration. Many former Irish emigrants returned home, and Ireland became an attractive destination for immigrants, from other member states EU such as Central Europe, but also from outside the EU such as Africa, Asia and elsewhere. With the 2008 onset of the Irish economic and banking crisis, the state's economy suffered, and Ireland has once again been experiencing net emigration of its citizens, but immigration remains high.
In November 2013, Eurostat reported that the Republic had the largest net emigration rate of any member state, at 7.6 emigrants per 1,000 population. However, it has the youngest population of any European Union member state and its population size is predicted to grow for many decades, in contrast with the declining population predicted for most European countries. A report published in 2008 predicted that the population would reach 6.7 million by 2060. The Republic has also been experiencing a baby boom, with increasing birth rates and overall fertility rates. Despite this, the total fertility rate is still below replacement depending on when the measurement is taken. The Irish fertility rate is still the highest of any European country. This increase is significantly fuelled by non-Irish immigration – in 2009, a quarter of all children born in the Republic were born to mothers who had immigrated from other countries.

== Immigration ==
Ireland's immigration history (and of one of a multi-ethnic society) is most of that of a country of emigration, remaining exclusively mono-ethnic for the vast majority of its 20th century history, rather than one of net migration and increased ethnic and racial diversity. However, starting from the mid-1990s, with the rise of the 'Celtic Tiger', the nation shifted to one of a net receiver of immigration at a rapid pace, changing from one of the most 'homogeneous countries in the EU, to a country with a rate of change almost unparalleled in speed and scale'. The Celtic Tiger economic boom saw a large expansion of the labour market, which contributed to the large increase of immigration towards the country, with the additional enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and later 2007 contributing to this immigration wave massively. Additionally, asylum seekers rose dramatically as well: from 364 in 1994 to 11,634 in 2002, before falling off towards the end of the decade.Net migration rate; 4 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2017 est.) Country comparison to the world: 28th


=== Nationalities ===
Ireland contains several immigrant communities, especially in Dublin and other cities across the country. The largest immigrant groups, with over 10,000 people, being Poles, Lithuanians, Romanians, Latvians, Indians, Americans, Brazilians, Spanish, Italians, French, Germans and the British.


==== Nationality of mothers ====
Of the 58,443 births in 2021, there were 45,381 babies (77.7%) born to mothers of Irish nationality compared to 43,019 (76.9%) in 2020. There were 8.4% of births to mothers of EU15 to EU27 nationality, 2.0% of mothers were of UK nationality, and 2.1% were of EU14 nationality (excluding Ireland). Mothers of nationalities other than Ireland, UK and the EU accounted for 9.8% of total births registered. There were 0.04% of mothers where the nationality was not stated.


=== Support and accommodation ===
Migrants are supported/represented by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Irish Refugee Council, Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, Nasc and the state's Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. They are mangaged by the International Protection Accommodation Service under the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) as well being policed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. Some minor parties have voiced opposition to immigration in the country and its capability to continue to let refugees in (like making claims that it is "full") including the National Party, the Irish Freedom Party and the Workers' Party (Ireland). The DCEDIY projected a shortfall of 15,000 beds for refugees in December 2022 and admitted that there was mounting pressure to house 65,000 people.Approximately 7,400 refugee adults and children were projected to be living in 38 "direct provision" centres across 17 counties in the Republic of Ireland by the end of April 2020. The Government of Ireland have said that they project to end direct provision by 2024 and are looking towards alternative forms of accommodation.
