The Voice of Vietnam or VOV (also Radio the Voice of Vietnam, Vietnamese: Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam) is the Vietnamese national radio broadcaster.  Directly controlled by the government of Vietnam, it is tasked with propagating the policies of the Party and the laws of the state.


== History ==
Prior to 1945, the Vietnamese were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from Dalat just a week after the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with the declaration "This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."  During the Vietnam War, Radio Hanoi operated as a propaganda tool of North Vietnam. In August 1968, Voice of Vietnam commenced shortwave broadcasts for Vietnamese living abroad.South Vietnam set up its own network in Saigon in 1955 from the roots of the ex-State of Vietnam's station, named as Radio Vietnam. Meanwhile, in 1962, the NLFSVN established their own radio station, named Liberation Radio Station.
Following Reunification, all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.
In 1990, VOV launched the first FM station of the network, with the original frequency at 100.0 MHz. At first, this station was dedicated to music, entertainment and information program. It later become the flagship frequency of the news and generalist station (VOV1), whereas the music content was transferred into the FM frequency of 102.7 MHz - which is the music station VOV3 at present.
The Vietnamese-language program for Vietnamese diaspora was first transmitted on 16 August 1991 on longwaves and shortwaves, following the foreign language programs since the founding of the radio network's external service. At the same year, the socio-culture oriented station VOV2 was established.
In 1998, Radio the Voice of Vietnam published its first daily newspaper, named Voice of Vietnam. At the same time, the first FM radio channel for the foreign community in Vietnam, operated-and-owned by VOV World Service, was inaugurated. The station transmitted at the frequency of FM 105.5 MHz in Hanoi and 105.7 MHz in Ho Chi Minh City. The following year (1999), VOV expanded its platform with the launching of the news webpage www.vovnews.vn (later www.vov.vn).
On 1 October 2004, VOV began transmitting VOV4, a radio station dedicated to minorities in Vietnam nationwide.
From 7 September 2008, to commemorate the 68th founding anniversary of the network, VOV launched their own television channel. Originally named Hệ phát thanh có hình (lit. Visualised Radio Station), it was renamed into Kênh Truyền hình Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam or Kênh Truyền hình Tiếng nói Việt Nam (Voice of Vietnam Television Channel) in 2012 after the VOV was licensed to operating the television system.
From 18 May 2009, the VOV Transportation Network was established. First transmitting officially in Hanoi on 21 June 2009 with the frequency of FM 91.0 MHz, it was expanded into the South, first with Ho Chi Minh City on 2 January 2010 with the same frequency, then to Mekong Delta region on 25 June 2017 with the FM frequency 90.0 MHz.
From 2015 to 2018, VOV co-operated with the Office of the Vietnamese National Assembly to broadcast a television channel which aimed at Vietnamese political activities and relatable issues.
On 2 June 2015, Voice of Vietnam officially acquired the VTC Digital Television Network from the Ministry of Information and Communications. It was first owned by the Vietnam Multimedia Corporation from 2004 to 2013. At the same year, the English-language radio station VOV English 24/7 went on test broadcasting in 1 October, and officially commence on-air more than a month later at 6 November under the frequency of FM 104.0 MHz.
In 2016, VOV relaunched the 89.0 MHz FM station into a health-oriented station.
