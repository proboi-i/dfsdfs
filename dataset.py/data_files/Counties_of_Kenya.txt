The Counties of Kenya (Swahili: Kaunti za Kenya) are geographical units envisioned by the 2010 Constitution of Kenya as the new units of devolved government that replaced the previous provincial system. The establishment and executive powers of the counties is provided in Chapter Eleven of the Constitution on devolved government, the Constitution's Fourth Schedule and any other legislation passed by the Senate of Kenya concerning counties. The counties are also single-member constituencies for the election of members of parliament to the Senate of Kenya, and special women members to the National Assembly of Kenya.As of 2022, there are 47 counties whose size and boundaries are based on the 47 legally recognized regions established by the 2010 Constitution. Following the re-organization of Kenya's national administration, counties were integrated into a new national administration with the national government posting county commissioners to counties to serve as a collaborative link with county governments.
