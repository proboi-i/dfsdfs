== Notes ==
Terms in italics
Terms in italics are terms in languages other than English. They should be in plural form, followed by a footnote or footnotes indicating the generally accepted English equivalent or translation. Known alternative spellings are given in brackets following a term.
Terms in brackets
Entries in standard brackets either indicate that the term used is informal or that its use is yet to be confirmed. An English term in square brackets indicates that the local name for the term is not yet known or confirmed; when confirmed, it is replaced by the local name in italics.
Footnote letters (dis m pro r)
These indicate, respectively, four common types of administrative division in English: districts; municipalities; provinces; and regions. Other English terms are also footnoted.


=== Administrative divisions with ISO 3166-1 ===
Administrative divisions with ISO 3166-1 are cited for statistics matters even when they do not have a special status (for example, the overseas regions of France).


=== Antarctic claims ===
Administrative divisions that are entirely Antarctic claims suspended under the Antarctic Treaty are not listed.


=== Autonomous areas ===
Not all the autonomous areas are part of the formal hierarchy of the administrative division system of a country (for example, the autonomous region of Zanzibar comprises 5 regions of Tanzania, the first tier on administrative divisions on that country). For more details, see List of autonomous areas by country.
