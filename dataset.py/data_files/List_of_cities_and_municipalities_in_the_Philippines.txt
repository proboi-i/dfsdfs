This is a complete list of cities and municipalities in the Philippines. The Philippines is administratively divided into 81 provinces (Filipino: lalawigan). These, together with the National Capital Region, are further subdivided into cities (Filipino: lungsod) and municipalities (Filipino: bayan).
Cities are classified under the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) into three categories: highly urbanized cities, independent component cities, and component cities. Cities are governed by their own municipal charters in addition to the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies their administrative structure and powers. They are given a bigger share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) compared to regular municipalities.
As of December 17, 2022, there are 148 cities (33 highly urbanized, 5 independent component, 110 component) and 1,486 municipalities encompassing the country.

Under class,  Mun  indicates municipalities,  CC  indicates component cities,  ICC  independent component cities, and  HUC  highly urbanized cities. Cells with thick borders mark official (de jure) provincial capitals.
