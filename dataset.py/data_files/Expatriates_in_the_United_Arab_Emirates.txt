Most expatriates in the United Arab Emirates reside in Dubai and the capital of Abu Dhabi. A number of immigrants settled in the country prior to independence.

Around 2,495,000 Westerners live in the United Arab Emirates, making up 5.1% of its total population.


== Background ==
The United Arab Emirates attracts immigrants from all over the world; this may be because UAE nationals prefer to work for the government or military.  The country's relatively liberal society compared to some of its neighbours has attracted many global expatriates, including people from western nations. Emiratis are outnumbered in their own country by a ratio of four to one. Under Article 8 of UAE Federal Law no. 17, an expatriate can apply for UAE citizenship after residing in the country for a period not less than 30 years, of which 20 years at least after the said law comes into force, providing that person has never been convicted of a crime and can speak Arabic fluently.
