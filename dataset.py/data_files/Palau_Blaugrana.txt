== Nou Palau Blaugrana ==

Under Sandro Rosell's presidency, FC Barcelona announced that by 2013, it planned to build a new Palau Blaugrana for its handball and basketball teams, with a capacity of 12,000 seats. Also included in the plan, was a smaller campus with a capacity of 3,000 seats, plus [a special conditions] for hotel partners (operated by a specialist company located on the corner of Aristides Maillol with John XXIII), new parking spaces and an auditorium, with a 2,000 capacity, for the foundation, including the offices of the club. These plans, however, were later dropped in favour of the Espai Barça project.
Under the Espai Barça project, the current Palau Blaugrana will be demolished, and a new arena is expected to be built on the site previously occupied by the Mini Estadi, which was demolished to make way for the new arena. Work is expected to start by the 2017–18 basketball season. The Nou Palau Blaugrana will have a capacity of about 12,500 people with an adjacent, smaller court that will seat approximately 2,000. Additionally, the New Palau will have 24 VIP boxes and 4 sky bars with court views.
