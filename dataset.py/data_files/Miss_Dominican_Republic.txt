Miss Dominican Republic (Spanish: Miss República Dominicana) is a national beauty pageant in the Dominican Republic.


== History ==

Miss Dominican Republic Organization has been in operation since 1927. In 1956, the pageant was officially restarted after crowning models from 1952 until 1955. In 1956, Olga Fiallo from Santiago won, making the Dominican Republic's first representative to Miss Universe. In 1966, the Concurso Nacional de Belleza Dominicana lost its Miss Universe rights for only one year but on that same year it gained their Miss World franchise sending the winner of that year, Jeanette Dotel from San Juan as their first representative. In 1967, the organization officially decided that the Winner would go to Miss Universe, First Runner-up would enter Miss World and Second Runner-up to a Festival of Latin Beauties in South America. The MRD organization had acquired the Miss International rights, but the organization would only send a representative if the budget allowed them. It wasn't until 1980, when they decided that the Second Runner-up would enter either in Miss International, Reinado Nacional del Café or Miss América Latina. In 1989 until 2000, the official Second Runner-up would enter Miss International, the Third Runner-up would enter Reinado Nacional del Café and the Fourth Runner-up would enter Miss América Latina. This has been the same until 2003 when the organization separated into two separate organizations.
