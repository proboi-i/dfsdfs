== High school career ==
As a freshman at Rufus King High School in Wisconsin, Poole once made a game-tying three-point shot in the closing seconds after coming off the bench. Poole visited Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Drake and Marquette as a blue chip high school basketball recruit. Then, he visited Michigan for the September 26 football game between the 2015 Wolverines and BYU, receiving an offer that weekend. He returned to campus on October 17 for the rivalry game against Michigan State. On October 23, 2015, four-star recruit Poole became the first commitment for the Class of 2017 after a home gym visit from head coach John Beilein and assistant coach LaVall Jordan and multiple Michigan campus visits. Poole had several competing offers including Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Memphis, Marquette, Virginia Tech and Auburn. At the time of his commitment, he was the 2nd-ranked overall prospect and the 1st-ranked shooting guard in the national class of 2017. As a junior, Poole was a 2016 WBCA All-State Boys Basketball first team selection.On July 1, 2016, Poole announced that he would transfer from Rufus King to La Lumiere School in Indiana for his senior year, where he would experience a campus lifestyle, play a schedule with several ESPN broadcasts, and be teamed up with then-unsigned class of 2017 prospects Brian Bowen and Jeremiah Tilmon. By the time Poole signed his National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for Michigan as part of a three-scholarship player incoming class with Isaiah Livers and Eli Brooks on November 11, 2016, he was the 90th ranked overall prospect. Poole was a member of the 2017 Dick's National High School Champion La Lumiere team. In the Dick's National Championship game, Poole posted 13 points, 3 steals, 3 rebounds and 4 assists, and shot 3–7 on his three-point shots. The 13 points included a shot clock buzzer beater in the closing seconds of the third quarter. La Lumiere, which included 2017 McDonald's All-Americans Bowen and Jaren Jackson Jr., defeated perennial power Montverde Academy, who was led by Canadian sophomore R. J. Barrett. La Lumiere had lost the 2016 Dick National Championship game prior to Poole's arrival.

After trailing by 14 points in the first half and 10 points at halftime, Michigan was trailing by 7 points in the second half when they made 7 consecutive three-point shots, including three by Poole whose 11 points made him one of only two double digit scorers for Michigan in the game. For the February 3 contest against Minnesota, the Maize Rage (Michigan's student section) held a "Poole party" in the stands, but Poole missed all four of his field goal attempts.

The shot was described as nearly identical to the buzzer beater he had made a year earlier in the Dick's National Championship game. Poole finished the game with 8 points and 2 rebounds, but his only field goal attempt in his four minutes of play in the second half was the game-winner. The play began with Michigan trailing by two points with 3.6 seconds remaining in the game and Isaiah Livers passing the ball from under the opposite basket to Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman near midcourt. After two dribbles Abdur-Rahkman threw the ball to Poole with 2 seconds left. The term "Poole party" was widely used in the press as a play on words to describe the celebration of Poole's heroic shot.

On the final day he went 4-for-4 to hold on to the lead, ending the season with 28 consecutive free throws made. Poole was not one of the three official finalists (Ja Morant, Darius Garland, and Dejounte Murray) for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, and finished fourth in the balloting (although he finished third in first place votes).

== Player profile ==
Although criticized when entering the league for his lack of polish, Poole has developed into a dynamic and efficient scorer throughout his tenure with the Warriors.  In addition to his shooting ability, Poole is a prolific finisher at the rim, frequently slashing to the basket using his ball-handling skills and speed while being a proficient mid-range shot creator. Poole's improvement in his all-around game has led to him becoming a capable passer, averaging a career-high 4.0 assists per game during his third season in a combo guard role. His combination of abilities has drawn comparisons to Warriors teammate Stephen Curry, with some basketball media writers calling him the "third Splash Brother".
