= Canton_of_Luxembourg = 
Luxembourg is a canton in the south of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its name, like the name of the Grand Duchy itself, derives from the name of its principal city, Luxembourg (more commonly known as Luxembourg City). It is not to be confused with the former district of Luxembourg, one of three administrative units in Luxembourg abolished in October 2015.
It is the only canton, other than Mersch, to be entirely surrounded by other cantons and therefore to have no international boundary. Its capital is Luxembourg.
