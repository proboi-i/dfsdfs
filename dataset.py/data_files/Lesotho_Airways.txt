Lesotho Airways, formerly Air Lesotho, was the national airline of Lesotho based on the grounds of Mejametalana Airport in Maseru. Until 1997, it was wholly owned by the Basotho government and operated both international and domestic passenger services to 16 destinations across 4 countries. Its main base was the Moshoeshoe International Airport. On October 1, 1996, Lesotho Airways had to suspend its international flights due to the inability to satisfy the minimum requirements specified by the Department of Civil Aviation. In 1997, Rossair Contracts Private Ltd acquired the assets of Lesotho Airways as it was financially insolvent.
