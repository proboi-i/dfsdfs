There are 7 cities (Latvian: Republikas pilsētas, "republican cities") and 81 towns (Latvian: Novada pilsētas, "municipality towns") in Latvia. By Latvian law, towns are settlements that are centers of culture and commerce with a well-developed architectural-infrastructure and street grid, and have at least 2,000 residents; however, a settlement can be designated a town if it has fewer residents, but fulfills all other requirements. To become a city, a town must have at least 25,000 residents. Additionally, cities should have a well-developed commercial district, transport, public utilities, social infrastructure, and be a significant center of culture. However, these requirements may be disregarded if there is sufficient population.
