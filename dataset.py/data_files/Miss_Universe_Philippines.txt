== History ==
From 1964 up until 2019, Binibining Pilipinas held the national franchise for Miss Universe, wherein it was responsible for selecting the Filipino women who would represent the Philippines and compete at the annual Miss Universe pageant. Under Binibining Pilipinas, the Philippine representatives to the Miss Universe pageant were crowned under the title of Binibining Pilipinas from 1964 to 1971 and Binibining Pilipinas Universe from 1974 until 2011. In 2012, the franchise renamed the Binibining Pilipinas Universe title to Miss Universe Philippines. The title was first given to Janine Tugonon during the Binibining Pilipinas 2012 coronation night, and has been continuously given to the competition's annual winner since.
In December 2019, the Miss Universe franchise in the Philippines was officially granted to a new organizing body with Binibining Pilipinas Universe 2011 and Miss Universe 2011 3rd Runner-Up, Shamcey Supsup-Lee as its national director and Binibining Pilipinas Universe 2006, Lia Andrea Ramos as its Women Empowerment Chair, paving the way for the creation of the new Miss Universe Philippines Organization. Under the new organization, a separate, standalone pageant is now responsible for the selection of the future Miss Universe Philippines titleholders from 2020 onwards.
