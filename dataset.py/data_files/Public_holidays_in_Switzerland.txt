The 26 cantons that make up Switzerland set their public holidays independently â€“ with the exception of 1 August, which is the only federal holiday. Furthermore, holidays can change depending on employers, and some holidays are specific to only a certain town or village. In general, the most reliable list of holidays for a given area will be found in a list of bank holidays, as nearly all shops and offices close during bank holidays.
