== History ==
The Micronesia Mall opened on August 8, 1988, a date chosen by its owners for luck: The number "8" is considered a lucky number by Chinese and other Asian cultures. Its first store was a Sterling Department Store, which opened ahead of the rest of the mall. The store was later purchased by Liberty House, which was replaced by Macy's in 2001. A major expansion was completed in 1988, doubling the mall's size.
