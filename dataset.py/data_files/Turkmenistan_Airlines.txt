The state-owned service Turkmenistan Airlines was founded 4 May 1992. In 1992, Turkmenistan Airlines became the first airline in the former Soviet Union to purchase a Boeing 737-300. In April 1993, Turkmenistan became a full member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The first flight on a cargo aircraft IL-76 was completed on 19 April 1993 from Ashgabat to Brest, Belarus.From 2001, the airline phased out its Soviet-era fleet for a more modern fleet of Boeing 717s, which were extensively used for service on domestic routes until their retirement. Seven of the 717 series were purchased; the first was presented at the MAKS air show in 2001. On 29 April 2009 a Boeing 737-700 was demonstrated in Ashgabat and on 2 September Boeing announced that Turkmenistan Airlines had confirmed an order for three more such aircraft worth $192 million.

Designed for 200 guests, it is located on Bitarap Türkmenistan şaýoly, which connects the city center to the Ashgabat Airport. On 1 July 2011, the airline began to operate an Electronic ticket system on all flights. Booking flights can be carried out in the standard way, but information about air travel began to be given out in the form of a passenger itinerary receipt.On 8 May 2013, a Boeing 737-800 was delivered. On 3 June 2013 a fourth Boeing 737-800 arrived, and on 18 December 2013 a fifth Boeing 737-800 arrived.In 2012, the airline began printing the full-colour magazine Lachyn ("Falcon").

In 2017, the air transport enterprise of the State National Service Türkmenhowaýollary was transformed into a joint-stock company Turkmenistan Airlines.On 4 February 2019, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) suspended Turkmenistan Airlines' permission to fly in the EU. This forced the airline to terminate its routes to the United Kingdom, France and Germany. In December, Turkmenistan Airlines resumed regular passenger traffic to European Union countries after a 10-month break.In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and for the safety of passengers, Turkmenistan Airlines suspended all international regular passenger flights in March 2020.
