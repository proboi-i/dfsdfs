== History ==


=== Miss Guyana ===
Since 1966 Miss Guyana was known as the Independent Queen whose winners represented Guyana at the Miss World contest. The first Miss Guyana was Umblita Van Sluytman from Georgetown. She became Guyana's first representative at the Miss World competition in London, in November 1966. A UPI photograph of her dancing on a table in her navel-baring, minimal costume for the pageant was published in many newspapers. She placed as a semifinalist.
